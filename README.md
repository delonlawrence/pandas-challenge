The Py City Schools data focuses on assessing the performance of schools in the Py City School District. It is conducted using a dataset that contains information about the schools, students, and their test scores. The goal is to pin point the factors that contribute to student success in effort to improve the performance of schools in the district.

From the Py City Schools dataset, these among other conclusions can be drawn:
School size:  Smaller schools in the data to perform better on average than larger schools.
School type: Charter schools tend to outperform district schools on average.
School budget: Schools with higher per-student budgets tend to perform better than those with lower budgets.
