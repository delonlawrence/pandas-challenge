Written analysis

The Py City Schools data focuses on assessing the performance of schools in the Py City School District. It is conducted using a dataset that contains information about the schools, students, and their test scores. The goal is to pin point the factors that contribute to student success in effort to improve the performance of schools in the district.

From the Py City Schools dataset I have completed:

School budget: Schools with higher per-student budgets tend to perform better than those with lower budgets.

School Size: Though my code did not run for the last part about student size it seems from the data that school size does play a roll in student performance.
